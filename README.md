# PSD to React.js Project with Vite and Tailwind CSS

## Musicology

This project demonstrates my skills in converting a PSD design into a fully functional React.js application using Vite as the build tool, Tailwind CSS for styling, and implementing responsive design principles.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to replicate the provided PSD design. The project showcases my ability to:

- Convert PSD designs into HTML and CSS code
- Set up a React.js project with Vite
- Utilize Tailwind CSS for efficient styling

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

## Project Structure

The project follows a typical React.js application structure:  
project/
├── public/
│ ├── index.html
│ └── ...
├── src/
│ ├── components/
│ │ ├── Header.js
│ │ ├── Footer.js
│ │ └── ...
│ ├── App.js
│ └── index.js
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── ...  


- The `public/` directory contains the HTML entry point (`index.html`) and other static assets.
- The `src/` directory contains the main source code of the React.js application.
- The `src/components/` directory houses reusable React components used throughout the application.
- The `App.js` file serves as the root component of the application.
- The `index.js` file is the entry point for rendering the React application.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

Navigate to the project directory:
cd project/  

Install the dependencies:
npm install  

Start the development server:
npm run dev  

Open your browser and access the application at http://localhost:5173.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates my proficiency in converting PSD designs into React.js applications using Vite as the build tool and Tailwind CSS for styling. The code structure and organization highlight my skills in front-end development.
